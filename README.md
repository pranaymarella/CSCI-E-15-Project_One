## About

This is my submission to Project One for Harvard Extension School's CSCI-E 15 Dynamic Web Applications.

## Requirements

- [XAMPP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)

## How to Run

I used XAMPP for this project.
- Once you download XAMPP, you need to download/clone this project into a folder called 'htdocs' which can be found within the location where you downloaded XAMPP.
- Open XAMPP and under `actions` click `start` on both `Apache` and `MySQL` modules.
- Now open your a web browser, and go to the address [http://localhost/CSCI-E-15-Project_One](http://localhost/CSCI-E-15-Project_One)
